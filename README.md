# Sublime Recent Tab Sort

This plugin keeps your tabs/open files sorted in order of activation, so that it matches the order that tabs are activated in when Ctrl+Tab-ing through.

There is a slight limitation in that the Sublime plugin API does not expose when you finish Ctrl+Tab-ing, and so the sort order is only updated when you move the cursor/update the selection in the file.
